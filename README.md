# BEGONE SPINS
*By [Danhosaur](<https://namemc.com/profile/Danhosaur.2>) / [DanielSimonsen90](<https://github.com/DanielSimonsen90>)*

Minecraft mod specifically made for people, who suffer from arachnophobia. Completely removes the entity and all its relations from the game.

## Installation
You can download the mod for 1.20.1 [here](./versions/1.20.1/begone_spins-1.0.0-1.20.1.jar). Can't promise it'll work on earlier or later Minecraft versions, but regardless feel free to [open an issue](<https://github.com/DanielSimonsen90/Begone-Spins/issues>).

For installing the mod into your minecraft game, make sure you have already played Minecraft 1.20.1 and have installed [Forge](<https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html>).
Once Forge has been installed, you can now search `%appdata%` on your computer, and navigate to the `.minecraft` folder, ensure you have a `mods` folder, and put the mod in there.

## Changes
* Prevents entity types from spawning completely. Spawn eggs, spawners & `/summon` will not work.
* Prevents entity sounds from being played using `/playsound`
* Changed item names that include the name of the entity to either "Spin" or removed the entity name completely.
* Zombies can now drop string & eyes.
